Essential Demographic Data For Planning A Restaurant In The Toronto Area

GOAL| Our goal in the study was in assisting future invenstments of new restaurant locations in the Toronto area and to make sure the right real estate is selected by presenting information pertaining to population and income of each neighborhood. This will also provide insight on the current competition.

DATA| To ensure prospective investors are presented with essential data we will combine Toronto's Neighborhoods shapefile and Foursquare API with Toronto's 2016 Census that contains: Population, Avg income/Neighborhood; in an ettempt collect info about competition in the same city.

Toronto Neighborhoods' shapefile - https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#a45bd45a-ede8-730e-1abc-93105b2c439f

Toronto's Census data - https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#8c732154-5012-9afe-d0cd-ba3ffc813d5a

METHOD| The various maps used in this study can assist prospective stakeholders in choosing an optimal spot for opening a restaurant in Toronto according to available competitors, population and incom. For this we use Census data from 2016 in combination with choropleth maps that show the more populated and richer neighborhoods. The Foursquare infromation is going to show restaurants that are currently open in each area.

RESULTS| Cross-referencing these maps will give us most restaurants that are clustered among main avenues in addition to the city's southern area, although some of the more wealthy neighborhoods tend to be north. Additionally, areas that show a more densly populated area do not reflect how many restaurants there are.

DISCUSSION| Before doing this report, the expectation was we would discover restaurants grouped together on certain parts of the map. This is not the case at all.

CONCLUSION| The study WILL be of assitance to one who may be looking into owning a restaurant inside of Toronto, if we compare the profiles of the neighborhoods and present offers, but it probably is not going to address every aspect, for example reliance on public transportation. Also, do not take the restaurant profiles for granted either.
